    <h1>Binary Search</h1>
    <div>This page is my first foray into the visualization of a process with <a href="www.d3js.org">d3</a>.
     Usually, I am seeking to visualize data.  In this case, I'd like to show how a binary search functions.
    Observe the following set of integers, drawn uniformly from the [0, 100] domain.</div>
    <br/>
    <div id="static_random_draws" width="800" height="200"></div>
    <div>Our goal is to determine whether or not a number we are seeking is contained in the set. If you will
    kindly provide a search target, we can get started.</div>
    <br/>
    <form name="search_target_form" onSubmit="return false">
        <div>
            <label for="search_target">Enter the integer you seek (and press Enter)...</label>
        </div>
        <input type="submit" class="submit_w_enter">
        <input id="search_target" type="number" min="0" max="100" step="1" autofocus="true"
               placeholder="Might want to keep that guy in the applicable number range">
    </form>
    <br/>
    <div>Thanks for the input! The binary search algorithm works by partitioning the search space, and then
    evaluating whether the number are seeking is higher or lower than the current breakpoint. Depending on
    the outcome of that comparison, the promising subset of numbers is then searched, while the rest of the
    numbers are ignored. The partitioning then occurs again, recursively, until the number is located or it
    becomes clear that the number is not in the set. Since subsets are selected on a comparison of numeric
    values, we must have a sorted array before the search can be executed.</div>
    <br/>
    <div>There are a wide variety of sorting methods that have been developed over time because it is a
    critical, yet computationally intensive process. Perhaps we will revisit a few of these down the road,
    but for now we will rely on the simple and inefficient selection sort. Suppose we have an unsorted
        array (Array A) and we seek to produce a sorted array (Array B). In a nutshell, the selection
    sort works as follows:</div>
    <ol>
        <li>Scan Array A</li>
        <li>Assign the minimum value to the first position of Array B</li>
        <li>Remove the minimum value from A</li>
        <li>Scan Array A a second time</li>
        <li>Assign the new minimum value to the second position of B</li>
        <li>Remove this new minimum value from Array A</li>
        <li>Repeat this process until all elements of A have been exhausted</li>
    </ol>
    <div>We can be even more explicit in our description with some fairly unambiguous code.</div>

        <code>
            // Instantiate arrays (array A is populated, but unsorted)
            var arr_a = [...]
            var arr_b = []

            // Develop a means to identify the location of the minimum
            // value in A
            function getMinValIdx(arr) {
                // Assumes input array is all non-negative
                var min_val = 101
                var min_idx = 0
                for (i = 0; i < arr_a.length; i++) {
                    if (arr_a[i] < min_val) {
                        min_val = arr_a[i]
                        min_idx = i
                    }
                return min_idx
            }

            // Sort the array by way of populating B
            for (i = 0; i < arr_a.length; i++) {
                var sort_val_idx = getMinValIdx(arr_a)
                arr_b.push(arr_a[sort_val_idx])
                arr_a.pop(arr_a[sort_val_idx])
            }
