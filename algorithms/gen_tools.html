<h1>General Javascript Functions for Data Analysis and Visualization</h1>
<div>This page is designed to hold the output from common javascript tasks I may employ during
any analysis of algorithms or other kinds of data analysis/visualization. For example, the motivating
case is the visualization of arrays, which are often the objects upon which algorithms operate.</div>

<h2>Display of Arrays</h2>
<div>Displaying arrays can be a relatively straightforward exercise as a one off, but if one wants
to service a more general set of operations, it becomes quickly apparent that javascript doesn't have
a great handle multidimensional arrays like the Python package <a href="http://www.numpy.org">numpy</a>
or it's predecessor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">Fortran</a>. Consequently, the
<a href="js/nd_array.js">nd_array.js</a> file holds a collection of useful functions for constructing,
interrogating, and visualizing arrays of artificial dimension.</div>
